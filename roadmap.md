### **1. Define Objectives and Scope**
   - **Objective:** Present nuclear energy-related phenomena (efficiency, cleanliness, safety).
   - **Audience:** Inform a general audience or stakeholders about nuclear energy through engaging visualizations.
   - **Focus Areas:**
     - Global distribution of nuclear power.
     - Temporal trends and advancements in nuclear technology.
     - Safety aspects and death rates comparison.
     - Energy consumption patterns and efficiency.

### **2. Prepare Your Webpage Structure**
   - **Home Page:**
     - Brief introduction to nuclear energy (efficiency, safety, etc.).
     - Why the data is relevant.
     - Overview of visualizations (anchor links to sections).
   - **Visualizations Section:** Subsections for each visualization, with explanations.
   - **Data Source Page:** References and links to datasets.
   - **About Page:** Project goals, methodology, and acknowledgments.

### **4. Data Visualizations**
   - **4.1 Global Nuclear Power Tracker (Map):**
     - Map visualization showing nuclear reactors worldwide with markers.
     - Use filters for operational, under-construction, and decommissioned reactors.
     - Tools: Leaflet.js, Mapbox, or D3.js.

   - **4.2 Race Chart (Temporal Trends):**
     - Show nuclear energy production trends by country over decades.
     - Highlight top producers (USA, France, China, etc.).
     - Tools: Flourish, D3.js, or Plotly.

   - **4.3 Bubble Chart (Death Rates):**
     - Plot death rates per TWh for nuclear, coal, gas, and renewables.
     - X-axis: Energy type, Y-axis: Death rate, Bubble size: Energy share.
     - Tools: Plotly, Matplotlib (Python), or Highcharts.

   - **4.4 Bubble Chart (Consumption and Efficiency):**
     - X-axis: Energy consumed, Y-axis: Energy produced, Bubble size: Plant capacity.
     - Segment data by regions (Europe, Asia, etc.).
     - Tools: D3.js, Tableau, or Excel (if visualized externally).

   - **4.5 Swiss Map of Reactors:**
     - Geographic map of Switzerland’s nuclear reactors.
     - Add hover information (name, capacity, operational status).
     - Tools: Google Maps API, Folium (Python).

   - **4.6 Linear Regression (Optional):**
     - Analyze trends (e.g., nuclear power production vs safety improvements).
     - Tools: Python (scikit-learn, matplotlib).

---

### **5. Web Development**
   - Use a simple framework like **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** or **Python Flask/Django**.
   - Libraries for embedding visualizations:
     - **Plotly/Dash:** Interactive graphs and charts.
     - **D3.js:** Advanced custom visualizations.
     - **Tableau Public/Power BI Embedded:** For polished visuals.
   - Host the webpage on **GitHub Pages**, **Heroku**, or **Netlify**.

---

### **6. Project Timeline**
   - **Week 1-2: Data Collection and Cleaning**
     - Compile all datasets and clean them for missing values, inconsistencies.
   - **Week 3-4: Data Visualization Creation**
     - Create and refine all visualizations.
   - **Week 5: Webpage Development**
     - Build the webpage, add content and visualizations.
   - **Week 6: Testing and Publishing**
     - Test responsiveness, interactivity, and content accuracy.
     - Deploy and share the final project.

---
