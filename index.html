                    This visualization provides an overview of the global nuclear energy capacity by country. It highlights the total capacity in megawatts (MW) with data from 1951 to 2024. this visualization was sourced from the Global Nuclear Energy Dataset. The capacities are represented as a choropleth map, where countries are color-coded based on their nuclear energy capacity. The data is plotted using the Plotly.js library. The visualization reveals significant disparities in nuclear energy capacity among countries. For instance, countries like the United States and France have substantial nuclear capacities, while many others have minimal or no nuclear energy production. This data is crucial for understanding global energy trends and the role of nuclear energy in achieving sustainable energy goals.

                    The Chernobyl disaster started in 1986's April 26th, when the Chernobyl's nuclear power plant reactor caught on fire, lasting for 10 days, resulting in the unprecedented release of radioactive material from a nuclear reactor. The power plant is located at 100 km from Kievin (Ukraine), but the effects of this accident reached far beyond its country borders.
                    The assessment of the radionuclide intake with food and drinking water was based primarily on several measurements of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 that were performed all over Europe, which are the radioisotopes reported in this dataset.

                    The plot showcases a clear timeline of nuclear incidents from 1945 to 2015. The dramatic spike in 1986 highlights the catastrophic Chernobyl nuclear disaster, one of the most severe nuclear accidents in history. The accident released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment, affecting not only the Soviet Union (now Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia) but also much of Europe.

                <div class="description" style="flex: 1;">
                    <p>Nuclear waste is the byproduct of nuclear power generation, medical treatments, and other applications of nuclear technology. It varies significantly in its volume, contamination levels, and the intensity of its radioactivity. While low-level waste dominates in volume (90%), it contributes only a negligible amount of radioactivity (1%), highlighting its minimal hazard. On the other hand, high-level waste, though just 3% of the total volume, carries a staggering 95% of the radioactivity, underscoring the need for robust containment and long-term storage solutions. Intermediate-level waste, at 7% of the volume and 4% of radioactivity, bridges the gap between the two extremes, reflecting moderate contamination levels requiring careful handling.</p>

                    <p>The largest amounts of radioactive elements like uranium and radon are actually released by coal, not nuclear energy. Burning millions of tons of coal each year leaves ashes as a waste product, which includes about 36,000 tons of radioactive materials globally. This material—comprised of uranium and thorium—is less radioactive than high-level nuclear waste, but there’s far more of it, and it is handled with far less care, exposed to nearby populations constantly.
                        Nuclear power plants produce approximately 6,290 tons of high-level radioactive waste annually in the form of spent nuclear fuel. Nuclear waste is highly radioactive but tightly contained in pools, dry casks, or other secure facilities, minimizing its environmental impact. (IAEA)
