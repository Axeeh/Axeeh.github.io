                    This visualization provides an overview of the global nuclear energy capacity by country. It highlights the total capacity in megawatts (MW) with data from 1951 to 2024. this visualization was sourced from the Global Nuclear Energy Dataset. The capacities are represented as a choropleth map, where countries are color-coded based on their nuclear energy capacity. The data is plotted using the Plotly.js library. The visualization reveals significant disparities in nuclear energy capacity among countries. For instance, countries like the United States and France have substantial nuclear capacities, while many others have minimal or no nuclear energy production. This data is crucial for understanding global energy trends and the role of nuclear energy in achieving sustainable energy goals.

                    The Chernobyl disaster started in 1986's April 26th, when the Chernobyl's nuclear power plant reactor caught on fire, lasting for 10 days, resulting in the unprecedented release of radioactive material from a nuclear reactor. The power plant is located at 100 km from Kievin (Ukraine), but the effects of this accident reached far beyond its country borders.
                    <br>
                    The assessment of the radionuclide intake with food and drinking water was based primarily on several measurements of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 that were performed all over Europe, which are the radioisotopes reported in this dataset.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>The plot showcases a clear timeline of nuclear incidents from 1945 to 2015. The dramatic spike in 1986 highlights the catastrophic Chernobyl nuclear disaster, one of the most severe nuclear accidents in history. The accident released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment, affecting not only the Soviet Union (now Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia) but also much of Europe.
                    The absence of significant activity before the 1980s underscores the relatively low occurrence of nuclear incidents during the early days of nuclear energy development. However, the post-Chernobyl period is marked by heightened global awareness and more stringent safety regulations, as reflected by the lower frequency of severe incidents in subsequent years.
                    The smaller peak around 2011 corresponds to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which further emphasized the importance of disaster preparedness in the nuclear industry.
