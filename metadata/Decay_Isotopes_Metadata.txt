Title: Decay Curves of Radioactive Isotopes

Context:
The graph illustrates the decay curves of three radioactive isotopes—Iodine-131 (I-131), Caesium-134 (Cs-134), and Caesium-137 (Cs-137)—over a timeline of 50,000 days. The y-axis represents the fraction of the isotope remaining, and the x-axis shows time in days.

The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the amount of time it takes for half of the atoms in a sample to decay into a more stable form. It is a measure of the rate of radioactive decay. Half-life is independent of the amount of the substance or its environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure).

Each isotope has a unique half-life, ranging from fractions of a second to billions of years.

Dataset:
The dataset was generated synthetically based on known scientific principles, specifically the radioactive decay law.

Columns in the dataset:
- Time (days): Time elapsed since the start of the decay process.
- Iodine-131 (Fraction Remaining): Fraction of I-131 remaining over time.
- Caesium-134 (Fraction Remaining): Fraction of Cs-134 remaining over time.
- Caesium-137 (Fraction Remaining): Fraction of Cs-137 remaining over time.

Half-Lives of Isotopes:
1. Iodine-131 (I-131): Half-life is approximately 8 days.

2. Caesium-134 (Cs-134): Half-life is approximately 2 years (730 days).

3. Caesium-137 (Cs-137): Half-life is approximately 30 years (10,950 days).

Formula:
The exponential decay formula was used to calculate the fraction of radioactive material remaining at a given time:
    N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt)
Where:
- λ (decay constant) = ln(2) / Half-life
- t = time in days
